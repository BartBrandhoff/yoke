# Yoke Micro-Framework

Yoke is a minimal and flexible polyglot middleware micro framework for [Vert.x](http://www.vertx.io), providing a robust
set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

## Instalation

To get started with Yoke in your project you can use Vert.x module system to download it from the maven repository or
include the maven dependency your self. The moment this module is only compatible with Vert.x 2. It can be backported to
the 1.x series but there is no work in progress in that direction.

The Vert.x module id is: `com.jetdrone~yoke~2.0.4`. If you prefer to use [maven](http://maven.apache.org), you can get
the artifacts using the following dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.jetdrone</groupId>
      <artifactId>yoke</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.4</version>
    </dependency>


## Middleware

Build quickly robust applications using the user-friendly API and existing middleware at your disposal.


## Performance

Yoke provides a thin layer of features fundamental to any web application, without obscuring features that you know and
love in Vert.x.
