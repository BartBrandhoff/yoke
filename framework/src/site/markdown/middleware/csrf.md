## CSRF

This middleware adds a CSRF token to requests which mutate state. You should put the result within a hidden form
field, query-string etc. This token should be validated against the visitor's session.
The default value handler checks request body generated by the BodyParser middleware, request query generated and
the ```X-CSRF-Token``` header field.

This middleware requires session support, thus should be added somewhere below Session.
